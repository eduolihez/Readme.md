<h1 align="center"> Readme.md Template </h1>

## Description
This project contains a template for a Readme.md inspired by [FreeCodeCam's article on “How to write a good README file for your GitHub project”](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/). The goal of this project is to help the community document their projects. It shows my Markdown skills and addresses the poor documentation of github projects.
